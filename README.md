# Solar System

This is a simple project that ilustrates the solar system. This code was inspired by Bobby Roe and their insightful YouTube videos on creating visual effects in Three.js. Their content served as a valuable reference and starting point for this implementation. Thank you, Bobby Roe, for sharing your knowledge!
